# JavaScript Data Types Overview

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that supports various data types to store and manipulate different kinds of values. Here are some fundamental data types in JavaScript:

## Array

**`Arrays`** in JavaScript are ordered, indexed collections of data. They can hold different types of values and are defined using square brackets `[]`. Arrays have numerous methods for manipulation and iteration, making them versatile for storing and managing collections of data.

## Object

**`Objects`** in JavaScript are versatile and dynamic data structures. They consist of key-value pairs and are defined using curly braces `{}`. Objects allow the storage of various data types and functionalities via methods and properties. They are widely used for representing real-world entities and complex data structures.

## String

**`Strings`** in JavaScript represent sequences of characters and are defined using single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`. They support various methods for manipulating and working with textual data, such as concatenation, extraction, searching, and replacing substrings.

## Number

**`Numbers`** in JavaScript represent numerical data and can be integers or floating-point numbers. JavaScript numbers support various arithmetic operations and mathematical functions. The Number data type also includes methods for formatting, converting, and checking numbers.

## Math Methods

JavaScript's **`Math`** object provides a set of built-in methods for performing mathematical operations. These methods encompass various mathematical functionalities like trigonometry, exponentiation, logarithm, power, rounding, etc., allowing developers to perform complex mathematical calculations.

## Date Methods

The **`Date`** object in JavaScript facilitates handling dates and times. It provides methods for managing date-related functionalities, including obtaining the current date and time, manipulating dates, formatting dates, and performing calculations based on dates. These methods enable developers to work with dates effectively in various applications.

JavaScript's flexibility and built-in methods for these data types make them fundamental building blocks for data manipulation, storage, and representation in web development and other JavaScript-based applications.
