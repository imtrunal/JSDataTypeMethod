# JavaScript Data Types Overview

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that supports various data types to store and manipulate different kinds of values. Here are some fundamental data types in JavaScript:

## Array

Arrays in JavaScript are ordered, indexed collections of data. They can hold different types of values and are defined using square brackets `[]`. Arrays have numerous methods for manipulation and iteration, making them versatile for storing and managing collections of data.

## Object

Objects in JavaScript are versatile and dynamic data structures. They consist of key-value pairs and are defined using curly braces `{}`. Objects allow the storage of various data types and functionalities via methods and properties. They are widely used for representing real-world entities and complex data structures.

## String

Strings in JavaScript represent sequences of characters and are defined using single quotes `''` or double quotes `""`. They support various methods for manipulating and working with textual data, such as concatenation, extraction, searching, and replacing substrings.

## Number

Numbers in JavaScript represent numerical data and can be integers or floating-point numbers. JavaScript numbers support various arithmetic operations and mathematical functions. The Number data type also includes methods for formatting, converting, and checking numbers.

JavaScript's flexibility and built-in methods for these data types make them fundamental building blocks for data manipulation, storage, and representation in web development and other JavaScript-based applications.
